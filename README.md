At the moment it all seems to be standing up with react@17.0.2 although my experience with it is very limited.
In the repository only the src directory is shared, for the rest you will need the standard web app scaffold, the field is fixed to be a 30x50 grid.

If you want to run **BFS** select the **A** setting from the control bar.

If you want to run **DFS** select the **B** setting from the control bar.

For each run you need to indicate start(*blue*) and end(*red*) points, blocks are optional.

Settings 1, 2, 3 load different fields of pre-populated blocks.
